### Old readme

Hello!!!

This piece of software was originally made to control a PC at school to make a cool presentation, but after i've added more and more features, it has become another kind of software (Still useful at school xD)

Works over Bluetooth, it is specifically made to be easy to control by any Android phone.

**EDIT: From 5.0.0 it now works over Bluetooth AND over a telegram bot.**

(Create a file named "token.txt" with the bot token in the exe directory and it will pick it up and work)

For the wiki update, you'll have to wait until i have some free time.

## Features: 
1. Control keyboard and mouse
2. Play sounds, even from the Internet
3. Password protection so that no one but you can access it.
4. Display images on the screen, message boxes...
5. Runs at startup, so that you don't need to worry about starting it.
6. You can copy text into the clipboard, rotate the screen and MUCH more!

For specific info about all the features, have a look at the [Commands wiki](https://github.com/adryzz/RemotePresentationManager/wiki/Commands)

PLEASE USE THIS ON YOUR OWN PC OR ON PCs THAT YOU HAVE THE PERMISSION OF USING THIS ON. Do this at YOUR OWN risk.

**For info about how to setup and use this, please go to the** [**wiki**](https://github.com/adryzz/RemotePresentationManager/wiki)
